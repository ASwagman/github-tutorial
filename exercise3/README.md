# exercise 3

# Purpose
Create a GitHub repo for your Insight project and add, commit, and push a change.

# Tasks
1. create a new repo on GitHub for your Insight project.
2. in your development folder, `git clone` this project repo to your local machine.
3. open a file and make a change (finish that function you were working on before this tutorial!).
4. `git add` your changes
5. `git commit` with a useful message
6. `git push` to the remote repository
7. repeat steps 3 and 4 until your project is done!

# Advanced Tasks
Say you have a working version of your project, but you want to make some changes. But you're afraid that if you make a change to your project, it will break and be difficult to recover the original working version. This is where git comes to the rescue!

If you want to add a feature or debug a bug on a working version of your project, create a new branch to work on that feature or bug. This means you can have a working version available to you while you continue to develop on the project.

Test the new branch. If you are satisfied with your changes, merge the branch with your original branch.
